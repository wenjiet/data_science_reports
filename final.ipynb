    "# Understanding the Community: Social Discovery of Artificial Intelligence Researchers and Literatures\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence is one of the most influential subjects in computer science. We will analyze scholars’ activities based on literatures published in the top-tier conferences to gain some interesting insights into this field. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we start by a brief introduction of the dataset and data processing. Then we present a temporal analysis of AI topic popularity. In section 3, spatial distribution of AI research is discussed. Next, in section 4, we implement community finding algorithm on coauthorship and citation graphs, which identifies important research communities and centers within the graph. Finally, we build a simple paper recommendation system based on content similarity and citation relationship. \n",

    "## Data Selection and Processing\n",
    "For this project, our data mainly came from two public dataset, DBLP and ArnetMiner. Apart from them, we also scraped data from Google Map for geographical information. In this section, we will discuss how we parsed them and how we used them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Selection\n",
    "DBLP is a well-maintained dataset of computer science bibliography. It contains 3,583,224 publications and 1,824,011 authors[1]. It covers a huge amount of computer science publications. Taking advantage of the widely covered publications, DBLP is used for analysing the trending of topics. We also gathered and formatted the co-authorship information for the analysis on community finding. However, DBLP has two obvious drawbacks. DBLP does not have well maintained author information and it does not have the paper citation data. It causes great inconvenience for our further analysis so we turned to a second dataset ArnetMiner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other public dataset we use is ArnetMiner[2], which is a supplement to DBLP that has well-maintained metadata including citations and author metadata. ArnetMiner contains 2,092,356 publications, 1,712,433 authors and 8,024,869 citation relationships[2]. Thus, we used the ArnetMiner dataset for community finding based on citation relationships. For the analysis of authors’ geographical distribution, we also scrape the geographical coordinates of the authors’ affiliations to locate each author.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing\n",
    "DBLP dataset is formatted in a huge XML file which contains all paper records and metadata. It become impossible and super slow to parse it by loading the whole file to memory. So it become a requirement to parse the dataset in stream. SAX, an event-driven parser is used to parse DBLP dataset. "

The size of the keyword is proportional to its frequency of appearing in the paper title.\n",

    "## Community Finding within Coauthorship and Citation Network\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully understand a research field, it is important to look at relationship between researchers. Coauthorship and Citation networks provide an easy way to address many of these questions. In this session, firstly, we made a simple statistic analysis on the network to identify the most-cited authors. Next, we implemented fast unfolding algorithm to identify different research communities within the graph. We visualize the citation and coauthor graph using open-source software Gephi. Through the visualization, we are able to identify important research communities, research fields and leading researcher within each field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, doing simple degree count on the graph, we were able to identify the most cited authors in recent years (20101-2016). Chih-Jen Lin and Chih-Chung Chang are ranked on top because of their work of LIBVIM in 2011. Jiawei’s work in data mining has profound influence on the field which makes him ranked at the 3rd.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"picture/graph/table.png\",width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we try to do community finding on coauthorship and citation networks. We implement the fast unfolding algorithm to extract the community structure. Here we will briefly introduce the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast unfolding algorithm is based on modularity optimization, which have considered the tradeoff for both runtime and efficiency. There are two passes in this algorithm. We add an edge for each pair of people who are the coauthor in the same paper, and then we build an undirected graph. Then we run the fast unfolding algorithm on this graph: For each node in the first pass, we try to find the best adjacent cluster, based on the highest modularity increments:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta Q= \\left[\\frac{\\sum_{in} + k_{i,in}}{2m} - \\left(\\frac{\\sum_{tot} + k_i}{2m}\\right)^2\\right] - \\left[\\frac{\\sum_{in}}{2m} - \\left(\\frac{\\sum_{tot}}{2m}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{k_i}{2m}\\right)^2\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And then in the second pass, we will merge the same cluster as one single point, and regard all the inner connection as one self connection with weight, and merge all the outer connection. This helps us to identify communities in a hierarchical way. Run this graph from the first pass, then we will have a compact graph in the end. Fast unfolding proved to be an efficient way to partition network into different communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coauthorship network provides rich information in research collaboration. By running fast unfolding community-finding algorithm on the graph, we were able to form collaboration relationship between authors therefore identify important research groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our coauthor network is generated by manually parsing DBLP dataset. The initial network contains 540k authors. We firstly filtered out authors who has less than 50 publications which left only 3220 nodes. Our algorithm were able to detect 73 communities within them. We selected top 100 authors and visualized our communities using Gephi software. Each color represents a research community where research collaboration is intense.\n",
    "\n",
    "![co-author graph](picture/graph/coauthor.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the network splits into many communities, many of which are groups with special characteristics. On the top we have a large  “data mining” group lead by Jiawei Chen and Phillip S Yu. The group also contains researchers outside US probably because their rich connection to Asia institutes. On the left, we have “computer vision” group lead by Tomas S Huang and Shuicheng Yan.  On the right, we have “Database & Graph Mining” group lead by Christos Faloutsos and Raghu Ramakrishnan. We also see some small groups at bottom such as “AI robotics” group of Sebastian Thrun and Wolfram Burgard, “learning & vision” group by Eric Xing, Fei-Fei Li and Michael Jordan.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the graph, we can tell several important observations. Data mining and computer vision are two of the most active research fields with largest research communities. Secondly, there are increasingly cross-regional research collaboration between different institute. For example, Jiawei Han is a professor located at UIUC yet his coauthor network has people from China, Singapore and UK. Thirdly, although we manually splits the network into different communities, they are not isolated from each other. Many cross-communities collaboration could be found within the network which demonstrates that researchers are working closely with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides coauthorship, we also study the cluster within the citation graph. Coauthor network allows us to identify different research communities while citation  network allows us to identify different research field and leading researchers within each field. We use ArnetMiner dataset for citation information which contains 28526 researchers and 191,128 citation links of AI research from 2010-2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "By running algorithm of this paper, we can partition the graph into 180 communities. We visualized top 100 most cited authors in the following figure. On the left, the blue and pink clusters are for machine learning and computer vision research. On the right, we have several small green and orange clusters for data mining. On the bottom, the dark red nodes represents NLP research communities.\n",

    "![citation graph](picture/graph/citation.png)\n",

    "We were able to make several conclusion from this graph. From the number of citation, we can tell that from 2010-2016, computer vision research has more citations than other research which indicates the popularity for the field. In the computer vision research field, based on citation analysis, it seems L.Van Gool, Li Fei-Fei, P.H.S. Torr are important researchers in the field. (The size of the node indicates its pagerank score.) For data mining field, the leading researchers are Jiawei Han and Nitesh V. Chawla. "

    "## Artificial Intelligence Literature Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "From our own experience of doing researches and writing research literatures on unfamiliar topics, it is always the case that we left some important papers out when there is no one instructing us. In this scenario, it would be extremely helpful if there is a system giving recommendations on related paper that worth reading. Therefore, at last but not least, we designed and implemented a simple literature recommendation system. Given a research paper the user is focusing on, the system can recommend the most related and influential paper to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendation problem is simply modeled by the Bayesian equation:\n",
    "$$P(l_i|l_q) = \\frac{P(l_q|l_i)\\cdot P(l_i)}{P(l_q)}$$\n",
    "Where $l_i$, $l_q$ separately denote the candidate literature and query literature. Since $P(l_q)$ is a constant to all $l_i$, we can further deduct the equation to:\n",
    "$$P(l_i|l_q) \\propto P(l_q|l_i)\\cdot P(l_i)$$\n",
    "For the problem solving, we define the likelihood $P(l_q|l_i)$ to be the topic similarity between $l_i$ and $l_q$ and the prior $P(l_i)$ to be the number of appearances of $l_i$ near by $l_q$ in the citation graph $G_c$ (to speed up the calculation).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For topic similarity, we separately calculated the similarity of the two publications’ titles and abstracts. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The title similarity is defined as the number of same bigram appeared in the two titles. Here, we use the k-gram index method[5] to firstly build a hashtable with the key of every bigram ever appeared in every title and value of a list of title indexes that contain this bigram. Then given a query title, the similarity calculation can be simplified to merging the lists found by the bigrams appeared in the query title. The score $S_t$ of title similarity will be the number of appearances of the titles in the lists.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The abstract similarity is calculated using the popular technique in search engine - Indri. For each candidate’s abstract $d$, we calculate the score $S_a$ with the query abstract $q$ using the following equation:\n",
    "$$ S_a(l) = P(q|d) = \\sum_{i} p(q_i|d) = \\sum_{i} (1-\\lambda )\\frac{tf_{q_i,d} + \\mu p_{MLE}(q_i|C)}{length(d) + \\mu} + \\lambda p_{MLE}(q_i|C) $$\n",
    "Where $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are parameters for smoothing, we take 0.1 here. $tf_{q_i,d}$ is the term frequency of query term in the doc, $p_{MLE}(q_i|C)$ is calculated as corpus term frequency of query term.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the likelihood $P(l_q|l_i)$ is calculated as:\n",
    "$$P(l_q|l_i) = 0.5 \\cdot (normalized(S_t(l)) + normalized(S_a(l)) )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the reference score $P(l_i)$, we simply count the appearance number of the papers which are within distance 2 from the query paper in the citation graph. So that this score will capture the popularity among the papers in  the small cluster of papers around the  query paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The system will then return the top 5 scored candidates as the recommendation paper.\n"
